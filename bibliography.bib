Additionally, slight access pattern modifications may lead to significant changes in performance due to complex interactions between hardware and software. These issues call for sophisticated tools to capture, analyze, understand, and tune application I/O. In this paper, we highlight advances in monitoring tools to help address these issues. We also describe best practices, identify issues in measure- ment and analysis, and provide practical approaches to translate parallel I/O analysis into actionable outcomes for users, facility operators, and researchers.},

IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.

Other examples

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.

journal article to be published as a misc entry type
date information like month and year is optional
However, the article form like that below may be a better approach.

}


book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).
@book{IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  series        = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  publisher     = "{CCSDS}",
  address       = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.
@manual{IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",

  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",

  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.

	abstract	 = {It is not uncommon to run tens thousands of parallel jobs on large HPC systems. The amount of data collected by monitoring systems on such systems is immense. Checking each job individually by hand, e.g. for identification of high workload or anomaly detection, is hardly feasible. Therefore we are looking for an automated approach, that can do this task.  Many automated approaches are looking at job statistics over the entire job runtime. Information about different activities during the job execution is lost. In our work, for each job, we reduce the collected monitoring data to a sequence of I/O behavior. Then, we convert the sequence to a footprint vector, where each element shows how often this behavior occurs. After that, the footprint dataset is classified to identify applications with similar I/O behavior. Human understandable class interpretation is the only non-automatic step in the workflow.  The contribution of this paper is a data reduction technique for monitoring data and an automated job classification method.},

	abstract	 = {The perceived I/O performance of a shared file system heavily depends on the usage pattern expressed by all concurrent jobs. From the perspective of a single user or job, the achieved I/O throughput can vary significantly due to activities conducted by other users or system services like RAID rebuilds. As these activities are hidden, users wonder about the cause of observed slowdown and may contact the service desk to report an unusual slow system. In this paper, we present a methodology to investigate and quantify the user-perceived slowdown which sheds light on the perceivable file system performance. This is achieved by deploying a monitoring system on a client node that constantly probes the performance of various data and metadata operations and then compute a slowdown factor. This information could be acquired and visualized in a timely fashion, informing the users about the expected slowdown. To evaluate the method, we deploy the monitoring on three data centers and explore the gathered data for up to a period of 60 days. A verification of the method is conducted by investigating the metrics while running the IO-500 benchmark. We conclude that this approach is able to reveal short-term and long-term interference.},

Mainly, this is due to the overwhelmingly complex interplay of the involved hardware and software layers. The Scalable I/O for Extreme Performance (SIOX) project provides a versatile environment for monitoring I/O activities and learning from this information. The goal of SIOX is to automatically suggest and apply performance optimizations, and to assist in locating and diagnosing performance problems. In this paper, we present the current status of SIOX. Our modular architecture covers instrumentation of POSIX, MPI and other high-level I/O libraries; the monitoring data is recorded asynchronously into a global database, and recorded traces can be visualized. Furthermore, we offer a set of primitive plug-ins with additional features to demonstrate the flexibility of our architecture: A surveyor plug-in to keep track of the observed spatial access patterns; an fadvise plug-in for injecting hints to achieve read-ahead for strided access patterns; and an optimizer plug-in which monitors the performance achieved with different MPI-IO hints, automatically supplying the best known hint-set when no hints were explicitly set. The presentation of the technical status is accompanied by a demonstration of some of these features on our 20 node cluster. In additional experiments, we analyze the overhead for concurrent access, for MPI-IO’s 4-levels of access, and for an instrumented climate application. While our prototype is not yet full-featured, it demonstrates the potential and feasibility of our approach.},

As the data volume continues to grow, the data movement between storage and compute nodes has turned into a crucial performance bottleneck for many data-intensive applications. Burst buffer provides a promising solution for these applications by absorbing bursty I/O traffic. However, the resource allocation and management strategies for burst buffer are not well studied. The existing bandwidth based strategies may cause severe I/O contention when a large number of I/O-intensive jobs access the burst buffer system concurrently. In this study, we present a contention-aware resource scheduling (CARS) strategy to manage the burst buffer resources and coordinate concurrent data-intensive jobs. The experimental results show that the proposed CARS framework outperforms the existing allocation strategies and improves both the job performance and the system utilization."

Typically, in procurements, the focus lies on the aggregated metadata throughput using the MDTest benchmark (https://www.vi4io.org/tools/benchmarks/mdtest). However, metadata performance is crucial for interactive use. Metadata benchmarks involve even more parameters compared to I/O benchmarks. There are several aspects that are currently uncovered and, therefore, not in the focus of vendors to investigate. Particularly, response latency and interactive workloads operating on a working set of data. The lack of capabilities from file systems can be observed when looking at the IO-500 list, where metadata performance between best and worst system does not differ significantly.",
